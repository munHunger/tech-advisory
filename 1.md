**The role as a Technical Advisor**
* How do you view the role as a Technical Advisor? Which requirements should a Technical Advisor fulfil?  
I view a technical advisor as someone who can understand both how business works and how to impact it in a successful manner using all sorts of technical solutions as they seems to fit.
The requirements of this is some general business understanding as well as a broad knowledge of tech possibilities(in our case, what IT can do for a business)

* Which parts of becoming a Technical Advisor appeal most to you? 
Being able to communicate in a language that someone without a technical background understands appeals to me.

* Which steps do you have to take personally to start to become comfortable in the role of a Technical Advisor?  
I see this from an agile approach. 
There is no way for me to know what steps to take to become a technical advisor, before first fully understanding what a technical advisor is and what I am currently missing.

**Expectations of the program**
* What do you want to get out of this program? 
I want to learn the business side of being a consultant.
That is learning how to convey any technical problems or opportunities to someone with a more business focused background

* What are you looking forward to the most in the program? 
LEARNING

**Mentorship**
* What do you expect from your mentor? 
I expect my mentor to have some debates with me and help me understand how the mind of a business oriented person works

* Which level of openness do you think is acceptable in a mentorship? Which limits would you like to set?
I want 100% openness with absolutely 0 limits. 
I feel like I won't learn what I want to learn if there are limits or if any sort of information is withheld from me.

* How do you create the right conditions for a good dialogue with your mentor?
